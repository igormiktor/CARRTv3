# The evolution of CARRTv3 

A series of photos capturing the evolution of CARRTv3 from the very beginning of prototyping.

## Prototyping ##

A very early prototype combined a Raspberry Pi Zero with an Adafruit Trinket for realtime tasks, powered by 12V 8x AA cells that used a UBEC to generate 5.2V output to power the IC and also directly powered the motors.  The prototype also included was an LCD with keypad and a motor-driver board.  The two photos below show the configure without and with the motors themselves.
