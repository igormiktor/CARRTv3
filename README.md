# CARRTv3
Cute Autonomous Robot Rover Thing (version 3 -- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Raspberry Pico based)

Version 2 was based on an AVR Mega2560 microcontroller, which proved to have too little memory to calculate paths.

To overcome this problem, CARRT Version 3 uses a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W as its primary processor, paired with a Raspberry Pico to handle real-time tasks.
