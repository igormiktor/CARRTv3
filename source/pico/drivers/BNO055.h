Keen observation. It has been known for quite some time that the system calibration indicator is jumping around, but the data is still reliable. 
After analysis we found the issue to be simply in the status indicator, not the data itself. We have a software fix for it, if we ever change 
the BNO055 firmware programmed at the factory. For now the workaround is simply to ignore this value.

Therefore we recommend that as long as Magnetometer is 3/3, and Gyroscope is 3/3, the data can be trusted. Pitch and Roll are more accurate 
with accelerometer calibration, but the impact is far smaller than Gyroscope or Magnetometer calibration. Especially in your case you mention 
that the application is a wearable, then I doubt there is a significant impact on the use-case between 1 and 2 degrees of error on the pitch and roll.

**********

Calibration values reflect Android definitions (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager#SENSOR_STATUS_ACCURACY_HIGH)

    - UNRELIABLE (0)    The values returned by this sensor cannot be trusted, calibration is needed or the environment doesn't allow readings
    - LOW (1)           This sensor is reporting data with low accuracy, calibration with the environment is needed
    - MEDIUM (2)        This sensor is reporting data with an average level of accuracy, calibration with the environment may improve the readings
    - HIGH (3)          This sensor is reporting data with maximum accuracy
